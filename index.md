**With more than 14'000 restaurants, food is a serious business in Chicago. But choosing where to eat is not an easy task, especially when you want to avoid risky places. Our choices are usually affected by the reviews of other visitors and the location of the restaurant. But do we ever wonder if a restaurant fulfils all sanitary standards?**

Using [Chicago Food Inspection data](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-food-inspections), our goal is to provide insights into food quality in the Windy City. We want to explore what are the violations that restaurants make most often, how they change over time and are they connected to the area where restaurant is located.
